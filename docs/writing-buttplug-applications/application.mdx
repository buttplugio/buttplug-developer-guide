* Scan for Devices
* List connected devices
* Allow the user to choose a device
* Allow the user to send a generic event to the chosen device

While most interaction will Buttplug will usually be more complicated or context specific than this, this example ties together all of the components of the client into a simple program.


<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="csharp" label="C#">

import CSharpApplicationExample from '!!raw-loader!/examples/csharp/ApplicationExample/Program.cs';

<CodeBlock language="csharp">{CSharpApplicationExample}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
