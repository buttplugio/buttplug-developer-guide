# Device Control

We've connected, we've enumerated, now it's time for the important stuff. Device Control!

## Device Capabilities

The devices Buttplug supports can do many different things. They may vibrate, stroke, rotate,
stimulate via electricity, some combination of all of these, or possibly something completely
different.

In order to trigger these different mechanisms, Command Messages are used. These messages all end in
"Cmd". For now we'll just look at vibrating and stopping, but there's descriptions of other messages
in the Winning Ways section.

When a device is added, it comes with a list of messages it can accept, as well as certain
parameters for those messages. For instance, if you have a vibrating buttplug (an actual buttplug
toy), it may accept the following messages

- VibrateCmd
  - This command can takes speeds from 0.0-1.0, or a list of speeds if a device contains multiple
    vibrators. For now, we'll assume we just have 1 vibrator.
  - When a device supports this message, it will send info about how many vibrators it has, as well
    as the number of actual speed steps it can use, so you aren't stuck guessing power values to
    send and can present the user with options or round to the nearest step in the 0.0-1.0 range.
- StopDeviceCmd
  - This command takes no arguments, and simply stops the device from whatever its doing. The
    Buttplug Server has enough information to know what actions a device can perform, so it handles
    making sure all of those actions are stopped.

You'll usually interact with devices with Device instances, which will be different than the
Buttplug Client. While the Client handles things like scanning and device lists, a Device instance
will let you command a specific device.

## Sending Device Messages

As a user of a Buttplug Client API, you should never be expected to send raw Buttplug Messages. Most
Client APIs will provide message sending functions for you, usually attached to device objects or
structures. If the device accepts the message type represented by the function you call, it should
be sent to the device. Otherwise, you'll receive an error about message compatibility.
