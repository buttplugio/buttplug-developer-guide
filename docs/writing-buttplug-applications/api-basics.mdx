# API Basics

Client implementations in Buttplug are built to look as similar as possible no matter what language
you're using. However, there may be instances where language options (i.e. existence of things like
first-class events) change the API slightly. This section goes over how the client APIs we've
provided work in a generic manner.

## Buttplug Session Overview

Let's review what a Buttplug Sessions are made up of. Some of this was covered in depth in the
architecture section, so this will just be an overview, while also including some example code.

Buttplug sessions (the connection lifetime between the client and server) consist of the following
steps.

- Application sets up a connection via a Connector class/object and creates a Client
- Client connects to the Server
- Client negotiates Server Handshake and Device List Update
- Application uses Client to request Device Scanning
- Server communicates Device Connection events to Client/Application.
- Application uses Device Instances to control hardware in Server
- At some point, Application/Client disconnects from the Server

## Library Initialization

Depending on which programming language and/or package you're using, you may have to run some code
prior to creating Buttplug instances and running commands.

If you're using Rust, congratulations, you don't really have much of anything to worry about. Isn't
using the natively implemented system great?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp" label="C#">

If you're using C#, we try to handle most of the initialization for you in our library. This may
include detecting architectures and loading libraries to make sure that we find the correct library
for the architecture you're running on. Hopefully this will be something you don't have to worry
about. If you do run into problems, [file an issue on our FFI
repo](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi).

Sorry Javascript/Typescript/Web users, unlike the other languages who don't have much to worry
about, this section is mostly for you.

While most of our native systems are fairly seamless, loading our WASM in web situations takes a bit
of extra work.

For those working on the web, here's a full HTML file example of how loading Buttplug for use works:

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<script src="[buttplug CDN url here, see buttplug-js README for location/version]"></script>
<script lang="javascript">
  // After we've loaded the module above, we'll have a "Buttplug" global we can access 
  // methods and classes from. We'll use that to initialize the library. This is 
  // required because of the way we have to load our WASM code into the application. 
  // You'll need to call buttplugInit(), which returns a promise that will resolve 
  // when WASM is loaded, at which point you can go ahead and run other Buttplug 
  // commands.
  //
  // We have this call in all of our examples in this guide, to remind users that
  // this must happen when running the library. If you do not call this, you'll
  // get errors in your developer console (and exceptions thrown) that will
  // remind you that you need to do it.
  Buttplug.buttplugInit().then(() => console.log("Buttplug Loaded"));
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

If you're using **Webpack** or another web application packing system in node, things can get
complicated depending on your application setup. Rather than add an example here that may need to
change often, [I'm just going to refer you to the buttplug-js README about webpack
setup](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi/tree/master/js#using-buttplug-with-webpack),
which will have the latest information on how to do this. If you have issues, either  [file an issue
on our FFI repo](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi) or [contact us via one of the
support mechanisms (preferably discord)](intro/getting-help.html).

## Client/Server Interaction

There are two types of communication between the client and the server:

- Request/Response (Client -> Server -> Client)
    - Client sends a message, server replies. For instance, when a device command is sent from the
      client, the server will return information afterward saying whether or not that command
      succeeded.
- Events (Server -> Client)
    - Server sends a message to the client with no expectation of response. For instance, when a new
      device connects to the server, the server will tell the client the device has been added, but
      the server doesn't expect the client to acknowledge this. These messages are considered fire
      and forget.

Request/Response interaction between the client and the server may be a very long process. Sometimes
100s of milliseconds, or even multiple seconds if device connection quality is poor. In languages
where it is available, Client APIs try to deal with this via usage of Async/Await.

For event messages, first-class events are used, where possible. Otherwise, callbacks, promises,
streams, or other methods are used depending on language and library capabilities.

## Dealing With Errors

As with all technology, things in Buttplug can and often will go wrong. Due to the context of
Buttplug, the user may be having sex with/via an application when things go wrong.

This means things can go very, very wrong. 

With that in mind, errors are covered before providing information on how to use things, in the
overly optimistic hopes that developers will keep error handling in mind when creating their
applications.

Errors in Buttplug sessions come in the follow classes:

* *Handshake*
    * Client and Server connected successfully, but something went wrong when they were negotiating
      the session. This could include naming problems, schema compatibility issues (see next
      section), or other problems.
* *Message*
    * Something went wrong in relation to message formation or communication. For instance, a
      message that was only supposed to be sent by a server to a client was sent in the opposite
      direction.
* *Device*
    * Something went wrong with a device. For instance, the device may no longer be connected, or a
      message was sent to a device that has no capabilities to handle it.
* *Ping*
    * If the ping system is in use, this means a ping was missed and the connection is no longer
      valid.
* *Unknown*
    * Reserved for instances where a newer server version is talking to an older client version, and
      may have error types that would not be recognized by the older client. See next section for
      more info on this.

Custom exceptions or errors may also be thrown by implementations of Buttplug. For instance, a
Connector may throw a custom error or exception based on the type of transport it is using. For more
information, see the documentation of the specific Buttplug implementation you are using.

**NOTE:** You may notice that there's no way to tell exactly what an error is from this message. You
get a class, but the information itself is encoded in the message, which is not standardized.
Therefore it's impossible to tell whether a device disconnected, or you just send a connected device
an incorrect message. This is bad, and [will hopefully be fixed at some point in the
future](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug/issues/70).
