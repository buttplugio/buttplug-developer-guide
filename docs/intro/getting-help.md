# Getting Help

If you have any questions about Buttplug that aren't answered by this guide, or if there's something you don't understand, please feel free to reach out to the community and library developers! There are multiple ways you can do this.

- [Buttplug Discord Server](https://discord.buttplug.io)
  - This is your best bet for real time help!
- [Buttplug Discourse Forums](https://discuss.buttplug.io)
  - If you prefer forums over discord, we've got those too!
- [Buttplug Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/buttplugio)
  - DMs are open, but replies may be slow.
- [Issues and Discussion Areas on the Github Org](https://github.com/buttplugio)
  - The org is made up of many repos, so if you're asking about a specific implementation of
    Buttplug, its best to do so on that repo (usually either
    [buttplug](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug) or
    [buttplug-rs-ffi](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi)). These repos have both issues
    and discussion areas, depending on if you are having a problem or just have a question.
